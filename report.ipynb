    "Starting with the description of the indicators we will be using and optimizing on our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RSI\n",
    "Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought(~70) or oversold(~30) conditions, as well as the momentum the asset may carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bollinger Bands\n",
    "Uses standard deviation and a simple moving average to create upper and lower bands around the price of an asset. These bands can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic indicator K\n",
    " Compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)\n",
    "Measures the accumulation and distribution of a security over a specified period. It combines price and volume to show how money might be flowing in or out of a stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why these indicators\n",
    "The combination of these indicators can confirm the strength and direction of a trend, as well as entry and exit points which will be used to build our two-asset portfolio.\n",
