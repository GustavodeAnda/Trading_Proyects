    "## Problem approach\n",
    "Starting with the description of the indicators we will be using and optimizing on our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - RSI\n",
    "Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought(~70) or oversold(~30) conditions, as well as the momentum the asset may carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Bollinger Bands\n",
    "Uses standard deviation and a simple moving average to create upper and lower bands around the price of an asset. These bands can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)\n",
    "Is a trend-following indicator that show the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. It helps us identify potential buy and sell signals, as well as trend directions. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### - Average True Range (ATR)\n",
    "Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for a given period. Provides insights into the degree of price volatility and can be used for setting stop-loss orders, identifying breakouts, and gauging potential price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why these indicators\n",
    "Using multiple indicators together can provide stronger signals and reduce the likelihood of false signals:  \n",
    "- ATR and Bollinger Bands help set stop-loss levels based on volatility, protecting trades from unexpected price movements. \n",
    "- RSI and Bollinger Bands help identify optimal entry and exit points by signaling overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "- MACD helps us identify trends and jump in or out of them when needed.\n",
