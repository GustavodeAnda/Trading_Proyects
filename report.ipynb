    "## Problem approach\n",
    "Starting with the description of the indicators we will be using and optimizing on our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - RSI\n",
    "Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought(~70) or oversold(~30) conditions, as well as the momentum the asset may carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Bollinger Bands\n",
    "Uses standard deviation and a simple moving average to create upper and lower bands around the price of an asset. These bands can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)\n",
    "Is a trend-following indicator that show the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. It helps us identify potential buy and sell signals, as well as trend directions. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### - Average True Range (ATR)\n",
    "Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for a given period. Provides insights into the degree of price volatility and can be used for setting stop-loss orders, identifying breakouts, and gauging potential price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why these indicators\n",
    "Using multiple indicators together can provide stronger signals and reduce the likelihood of false signals:  \n",
    "- ATR and Bollinger Bands help set stop-loss levels based on volatility, protecting trades from unexpected price movements. \n",
    "- RSI and Bollinger Bands help identify optimal entry and exit points by signaling overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "- MACD helps us identify trends and jump in or out of them when needed.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, the benchmark was consistently outperformed by our strategy, which, for all four datasets, was composed of only one (1) indicator. We initially anticipated that more complex strategies would emerge, but the results indicate that simplicity can be effective, at least during the training phase. This outcome suggests that a minimalistic approach might often be enough, challenging the common assumption that more indicators lead to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the testing phase, for both BTC datasets, the best strategy turned out to be simply buying and holding. Given the high volatility of this asset, this result is not entirely surprising, though we initially believed an active strategy might outperform the benchmark. In contrast, for the AAPL datasets, an active strategy was required to surpass the benchmark. This result aligned with our expectations for this asset. However, the most effective strategy still involved the use of just one (1) indicator, rather than a combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings lead us to conclude that sometimes simple models can effectively accomplish the task at hand, proving to be as efficient as many more complex and robust models. This emphasizes the value of simplicity in model design and suggests that more elaborate strategies do not necessarily yield better results. Thus, our research underscores the importance of considering both simplicity and complexity in the development of trading strategies, recognizing that a straightforward approach can often be just as powerful.\n"
